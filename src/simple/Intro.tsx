        that will make you go bankrupt.<br/>
        It all started with an idea of two childhood friends, to bring together in one place, all the basic food needs
        and the daily necessities, at the cost of your mom's rent and your grandmother's pension.<br/>
        Yafo's supermarket is your place to enjoy high quality products
        with prices you probably cannot afford, because you are poor.
